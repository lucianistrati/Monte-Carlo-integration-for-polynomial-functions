# Monte Carlo Integration for Polynomial Functions

## Overview

This project implements Monte Carlo integration for polynomial functions. Monte Carlo integration is a numerical method for estimating the value of definite integrals by generating random samples from the domain of the function and computing their average value.

## Results

### Integral Calculation Summary:

- **Mathematically for [-5, 5] the integral value is**: -115.0000
  - **Integral of function f for points -5.0 to 5.0**: After 100 simulations and 300000 points drawn, the integral value is -115.0951

- **Mathematically for [0, 5] the integral value is**: 159.6875
  - **Integral of function f for points 0.0 to 5.0**: After 100 simulations and 100000 points drawn, the integral value is 159.6753

- **Mathematically for [-5, -0.39] the integral value is**: -274.9000
  - **Integral of function f for points -5.0 to -0.3943**: After 100 simulations and 100000 points drawn, the integral value is -274.7704

- **Mathematically for [-0.39, 0.0] the integral value is**: 0.2200

### Notes:
- The results are rounded to 4 decimal places.
- Each simulation involved drawing a specified number of random points within the given interval.
